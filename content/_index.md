I dislike boxes. I engineer, develop, test, and deliver software. Currently
building systems to manage OpenShift quality signals at scale at Red Hat.

My path here winds through OpenShift upgrade engineering, cloud-native CI/CD
tooling, financial web development, and academic research in static analysis
and formal methods.

Building software is much more than coding — coding is just a skill. It's a
collaborative activity, and I'm constantly learning to be better at all of it.
